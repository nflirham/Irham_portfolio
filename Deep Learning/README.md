# Deep Learning
During my course on deep learning, i rarely used library for deep learning such as tensorflow or pytorch. My professor taught me to build deep learning network from scratch.
It was a wonderful experience to finally understand how deep learning works and how it could really ease human problems at almost every aspect of life
