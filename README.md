# Irham's portfolio
Hello! My name is Muhammad Naufal Irham Ramdhani. I'm a third year actuarial student from Bandung Institute of Technology.

In this portfolio, i want to show you my skills on data analytics and data science. I have so many project during my year as actuarial student, but here is some of the work that i interested the most:

1. Deep learning
2. Time series analysis
3. Macroeconomy analysis
4. Microeconomy analysis
5. Generelized linear model

Mostly i used python and R for analyzing data. I may never have a project that needs to use SQL, but i recently i have been solve at least 50 SQL problems on HackerRank, so if you want to know how good the skill i have on SQL, you should check my hacker rank page https://www.hackerrank.com/nflirham21

I'm sorry if it's a little messy, because i'm still new on github. But i can assure you that i will keep updating regularly
