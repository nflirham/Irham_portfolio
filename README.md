# Irham's portfolio
Hello! My name is Muhammad Naufal Irham Ramdhani. I'm a final year actuarial student from Bandung Institute of Technology. A little bit about me, I am very passionate about finance and data analysis. I am a regular user of Python, SQL, and R. I know a little bit of Tableau and want to know more about tableau, but I had never come across projects that used Tableau. Recently, I have been an actuarial intern at PT. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia (PT. ASKRINDO) for 2 months. 

In this portfolio, I want to show you what projects I had made during my time in college and as an actuarial intern. Here is some of the work that I am interested in the most:

A. Projects in College:

  1. Deep learning
  2. Time series analysis
  3. Macroeconomy analysis
  4. Microeconomy analysis
  5. Generalized linear model

B. Projects in PT.Asuransi Kredit Indonesia:

  1. Estimating Ultimate Claim for 10+ classes of business with Chain Ladder Method
  2. Estimating Premium Rate on credit insurance for 70+ banks
  3. Calculate pricing on consumptive credit insurance with Pluto-tache Method
