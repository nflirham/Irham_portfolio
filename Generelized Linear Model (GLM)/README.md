# Generelized Linear Model

This assignment was an individual project. In this assignment, i originally tried to model the probability of an english premiere league club to win a game given the difference goal between the teams, but in the end, i changed the explanatory variable to be whether the tema play at home or away, who is the opponent, and the expected statistics from each club. I changed the explanatory varible because i think the updated model would be more useful because the model could predict the outcome before the teams played and not depend on half time result. The method i used was Generelized Linear Mixed Model where the model assume that the response variable had a correlation.
